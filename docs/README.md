# Reagentic Documentation
<generated>
Welcome to the Reagentic framework documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides and references for using the Reagentic AI agent framework.

## üìö Documentation Index

### Core Concepts

- **[Subsystem Pattern](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md)** - Comprehensive guide to the modular subsystem architecture
  - Learn how to create reusable, self-contained components
  - Understand tool categorization and agent integration
  - Explore advanced patterns and best practices

### Framework Features

- **[Logging System](LOGGING.md)** - Complete logging and observability guide
  - Structured logging with JSON format
  - Context tracking and performance monitoring
  - Integration with agents and providers

## üöÄ Quick Navigation

### Getting Started

- [Memory Subsystem Example](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#memory-subsystem-example) - Working with built-in memory

### Advanced Topics
- [Multi-Category Tools](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#multi-category-tools) - Organize tools by functionality
- [Event-Driven Subsystems](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#event-driven-subsystems) - Handle subsystem events
- [Integration Patterns](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#integration-patterns) - Combine multiple subsystems

### Best Practices
- [Architecture Guidelines](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#architecture) - Design patterns and principles

- [Troubleshooting](SUBSYSTEM_PATTERN.md#troubleshooting) - Common issues and solutions

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture

The Reagentic framework is built around several key concepts:

1. **Subsystems** - Modular, reusable components that provide specific functionality
2. **Tools** - Agent capabilities exposed through the subsystem pattern
3. **Categories** - Logical groupings of tools for flexible agent configuration
4. **Events** - Reactive patterns for subsystem interaction and monitoring

## üìñ Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these standards:
- **Clear Examples**: Every concept includes working code examples
- **Type Safety**: Full typing information for all APIs
- **Best Practices**: Guidance on proper usage patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Follow the established format and style
2. Include practical examples
3. Update this index with links to new documents
4. Ensure all code examples are tested and working
